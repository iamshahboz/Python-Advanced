Difference between process and thread. 
Proccess is an instance of program. For example if I am running one firefox browser it is one process
Running one python interpreter- it is another process

Thread in another hand is an entity within a process.
So a process can have multiple thread inside


Processes:
-Takes advantage of multiple CPU and cores
-Separate memory space -> memory is not shared between processes 
-Great for CPU-bound processing
-New process is stated independently from other processes
-Proccesses are interaptible/killable
-One GIL for each processes 


Disadvantages:
-Heavyweight 
-Starting a process is lower than starting a thread
-More memory
-IPC(inter-process-communication) is more complicated


Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled
A process can spawn multiple threads

-All threads withing a process share the same memory
-Lightweight
-Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
-Great for I/O bound tasks

Cons:
Threading is limited by GIL
No effect for CPU bound tasks
Not killable
Careful with race conditions
